# IntelliInspect Project Overview

## The Big Picture: How It All Works Together

IntelliInspect represents a masterful orchestration of modern web technologies, creating what we like to call the **"three-tier dance"** between an Angular frontend, .NET Core backend, and Python FastAPI ML service. Think of it as a sophisticated relay race where each runner has specialized skills, seamlessly passing the baton to deliver real-time manufacturing quality predictions.

**The Journey Begins**: Users interact with a polished Angular interface that guides them through a intuitive four-step workflow. The frontend acts as the conductor of this technological symphony, managing everything from drag-and-drop file uploads to real-time WebSocket streaming visualizations. The application employs a sophisticated **chunked upload mechanism** that can handle massive 2.5GB CSV files by breaking them into digestible pieces—imagine trying to eat a whole pizza versus enjoying it slice by slice.

**The Orchestration Layer**: The .NET backend serves as the diplomatic intermediary, fluent in both Angular's JavaScript dialect and Python's scientific computing language. It's not just a simple proxy; it's an intelligent gateway that handles JWT authentication, manages WebSocket connections, and translates requests between different architectural paradigms. When the frontend calls `/api/Data/finish-upload`, the backend coordinates a complex dance of chunk reassembly and data processing with the ML service.

**The Brain**: The Python FastAPI service represents the analytical powerhouse, implementing cutting-edge machine learning techniques specifically optimized for Bosch production line scenarios. It features a **revolutionary single-pass CSV processing algorithm** that can transform massive datasets into optimized Parquet format while simultaneously extracting metadata—all without breaking a computational sweat.

**Real-Time Magic**: Perhaps the most impressive achievement is the **WebSocket simulation architecture**. Picture a three-way conversation where the Angular frontend whispers to the .NET backend, which then relays messages to the Python service, creating a real-time stream of predictions that updates dashboards at one-second intervals. It's like having a crystal ball that predicts manufacturing defects as they happen.

**Memory Architecture Insight**: The current model training process is architected for maximum performance by loading the entire dataset into memory at once. This design choice requires the server to have enough RAM to comfortably hold a 2GB Parquet file, ensuring lightning-fast processing speed during the critical training phase—a trade-off that prioritizes performance over memory conservation.
